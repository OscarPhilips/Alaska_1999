        the mosquitos were terrible, we did a little hiking
        around and were eaten alive. It was also about 85 degrees
        out, so we cleaned up and went to bed early.<p>The
        campground we stayed in was a primitive campground (no
        water), well off the highway, some 15 miles by gravel
        road, but there were still some 18 campers there.</p>
        <p>Wildlife for the day included: praire dogs (lots);
        pronghorn antelope (30); and deer (8).</p>
