        the Denali Park bus tours, where you ride, along with ~50
        others, through the park on a closed road. At first this
        did not sound all that great (other than the fact there
        is little other way to get into the park, without walking),
        but the tour offered a lot of wild life viewing
        opportunities.</td>

        were out eating some of the moss and lichen that grows in
        the taiga.</td>

        and while offering excellent binocular viewing
        opportunities, did not offer good picture taking

        us through the pines.</td>

        amoung the group. This sheep was grazing just off the
        road, most of the groups with young were out of camera
        range, but again easly viewed with binoculars.</td>

        put on by the National Park Service Rangers. The dogs are
        actually used, in dog sled service, here in the park by
        the rangers during the winter months.</td>
