        pictures of water splashing, that was it. But two Sea
        Otters were much more accomodating; rolling atound next

        still a little cool, about 55 degrees. There were few
        clouds and almost no haze. The captain pointed out
        Montague Island, some 80 miles away that can only be seen
        from the fjords area about four times a year. In addition
        to the wildlife, there were numerous waterfalls on the
        stone cliffs.</td>
