        the travel is slow. There are a number of stops to view
        the sights, such as this modern placer gold mine. Quite a
        difference compared to Dredge #4 from a few days ago, but
        the same basic technology is used for separating the gold
        from the rocks and sand.</td>

        Days (1872-80), and a major boat building town for the
        area.</td>

        &quot;travel day&quot; and only made it 225 miles. And we
        didn't see one large mammal - skunked! No moose... No
        bear... No deer... No sheep, nor goats. No elk or caribou
        - nothing but forest, hills, mountains, ponds, lakes,
        rivers and streams ... still very nice.<p>But speaking of
        ponds, lakes rivers and streams; we did goof off a little
        today and did some casual fishing - landed one 10&quot;
        rainbow trout (released), and had two others on the hook
        (barbless hooks are fun).</p>
