        Ramada Inn at about 8:00. The weather cleared, with a few
        less clouds than yesterday.<p>This is also Victoria Day,
        a holiday in Canada, so many places are closed. This is
        the last day of their three-day weekend, which for most
        marks the beginning of summer, so anyone who camps,
        fishes, or owns an ATV is in the woods for the weekend.</p>

        mile walk, but well worth it.</td>

        <td colspan="2">We pulled into the camp grounds at Stone
        Mountian (or Summit Lake) at 7:30 after traveling 356
        miles. The camping spot we had was just about 40 feet
        from Summit Lake, which is still frozen. The lake and
        wide open setting of this campground made for a very
        windy night.<p>Most of the miles were on excellent roads,
        we should be so lucky to have roads like this in Ohio.
        The only exception was 10 miles of packed gravel, and
        even that was better than the construction zone on I680
        in Youngstown.</p>
        <p>Our last 25 miles or so were on more or less original
        Alaskan Highway (the previous miles have been tamed by
        straightening and leveling). The road base is great, but
        the curves a little extreme, and there appears to be no
        funding for guard rails.</p>
        <p>Wildlife for the day included: moose (2); black bear (1);
        mule deer (3); stone sheep (2) and caribou (2).</p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000">OK - Kim, you got me, we got to
        see the Aurora Borealis tonight. It was not very bright,
        or colorful, mostly shades of green/blue - too cold to
        even think about trying to get the camera out.</font></p>
