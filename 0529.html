        Palmer.</td>

        very educational show with regards to the Musk Ox's past
        and future. Part of that future is their breeding program
        that helps ensure the long term viability of the Musk Ox.<p>Here

        lot of sight seeing. In addition to the farms above we
        stopped by a wolf kennel, which was not nearly as well
        done as either farm, and drove up to the Independance
        Mine State Historical Park, which is still closed for the
        season.<p>Wildlife for the day included: moose (1); hoary
        marmots (kind of like a ground hog) (2).</p>
        <p>We are joined by another today. Merry Lou (Donald's
        wife, Dean's Mom) flies in at 11:30PM (Alaska time, 3:30AM
        her time), so we checked in to the hotel early (3:00);
        giving us time to clean out the van a little - so Merry
        Lou does not get too excited. We also had the oil changed,
        and a few of those other housekeeping chores.</p>
