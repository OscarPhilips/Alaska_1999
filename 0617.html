        here in Yellowstone, but the campgrounds are full anyway,
        so we had to drive out of the park to find a place to
        stay. We landed at the Grizzley Hotel in Silver Gate,
        Montana, just a few miles from the North-East Yellowstone
        Entrance - it was starting to rain again as we pulled in,
        so I was glad not to be camping. </p>
        <p>Wildlife for the day included: yellow-bellied marmot (1);
        mule deer (3); elk (56); buffalo (160); prong horn
        antelope (4); and coyote (1).</p>
