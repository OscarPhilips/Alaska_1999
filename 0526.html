        leaving at 8:00. A little later than normal start, but no

        them and putting some miles on.</td>

        mountains, and more mountains. At least they are much
        more beautiful than the plains, but the time in the car
        gets a little boring none the less.</td>

        thing in the bush is a porcupine. It was very marshy
        there so I was not going to go in and try and get him to
        turn around. Donald though about it though.</td>

        we finally saw Dall Sheep, lots of them. They were all
        over the mountain (a little too far for pictures), but
        when we left the visitor's center we found them right
        down at road level.</td>

        today, a town of 25,000 people. We took the MacBride
        Museum in; it was a little eclectic, covering animals of
        the Yukon, geology, and the Gold Rush, but the exibits
        were well done and worth the stop.<p>We pulled into the
        camg grounds at Burwash Landing at 6:30 after traveling
        375 miles. Again we camped not too far off a frozen (partialy)
        lake, but we were well protected from the winds.</p>
        <p>Wildlife for the day included: porcupine (1); dall
        sheep (bunch).</p>
