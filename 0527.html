        of those back home we have tried to call at the wrong
        times in Ohio can attest). That is Don with the sign.</p>

        the first time this trip, we suffered some delays due to
        road constuction. We hit three construction zones today,
        each resulting in 15-30 minutes of lost time. </p>

        snowshoe rabbits (lots of them).</p>
