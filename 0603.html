        preparation for rafting this morning, we drove portions
        of the river last night and watched one of the other Raft
        Outfitters running their maiden voyage of their Hydro
        Bronc. They told us it had just arrived in the mail that
        morning.</p>
        <p>Kind of like a gerbil wheel for people that you walk
        down rivers in. Little out of control.</p>

    <tr>
        <td>Our raft trip was a little more conventional -- a
        little. They wrap you up in a mustang suit (the kind you
        can jump into the Artic Ocean in and have some hopes of
        surviving), add a life vest, gloves, and rubber boots
        with thick socks, and jump in the raft.<p>The water was
        part of some glacier 10 hours ago, so it is not all that
        warm, 34 degrees, but the trip was fun, and we were not
        all that cold.</p>
