        little sight seeing. Along our way we had to slow down a
        little to let this guy get across the road. Mr. Porcupine
        sure took his time, but when he got off the road surface
        he was gone in a flash.</td>

        after getting skunked on the large mammals yesterday.
        This bear had two cubs along with her when we first saw
        her crossing the road ahead of us, but the weeds are high
        along the road already and they quickly ducked out of
        sight, but mom bear gave one last glance back at us
        before she disappeared also.</td>

        the town of Kitseguecla and Kitwancool to look at the
        totem poles there. <p>By the way the name &quot;Kitwancool&quot;
        means &quot;place of reduced number,&quot; and was used
        as the town's name after many of the inhabitants were
        killed in raids by other tribes. </p>

        clear sky.</td>

        large and fire wood is provided at no cost. These parks
        have also proven to be extremly quiet at night.<p>By the
        way, that white stuff you see is not snow (I wish, it is
        71 degrees out and the mosquitos love it), it is the
        seeds from all the quaking aspen trees around here;
        unluckily it gets everywhere.</p>

        porcupine (1); black bear (5, including one mom with two
