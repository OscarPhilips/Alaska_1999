        started the day right here in Thunder Bay by touring Fort
        William. A recreation of the origninal 1815 fort,
        complete with interpretive actors playing roles of many
        of the fort's personnel.<p>We took the guided tour of the
        Fort, but being this early in the season, and on a week
        day, we had to suffer through a guided tour of just the
        two of us and the guide. During the summer these tour
        groups may have 30 people in them.</p>
        <p>The recreation of the Fort is extremely well done and
        the interpretive guides do an excellent job of acting the
        part they are playing. There were hundreds of actual furs
        in the trading post, as well as a good representation of
        the goods the North West Company traided. I am sure this
        will be one of the highlights of the trip.</p>
        <p>The fort was built at the western head quarters of the
        North West Company.</p>

        high. Under their agreement with the Province, the hydro
        company allows 150 cubic feet per second of water to flow
        over the fall mid weekday, such as when we visitied. The
        flow is increased to 300 cfm on weekends, and shut off at
        night. The ballance of the water is used to generate
        electricity after it flows down three penstocks, each 10
        feet in diameter! Could you imagine if all that water
        were flowing over the falls?</td>
