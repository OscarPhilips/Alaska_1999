        Gold Rush days. This picture was actually taken last
        night, or early this morning if you will, at about 1:30AM!</td>

        restored by the Parks Canada. Gold Dredge #4 (and some of
        its brothers) actually have some Ohio heritage, being
        manufactured in Marion, Ohio, by Marion Power Shovel -
        then shipped by various rail, steam ship, and horse drawn
        means to the site and assembled. This is the largest
        wooden hulled bucket-line dredge ever built in North
        America.<p>The interpretive guide from Parks Canada kept
        talking about this piece of equipment, manufactured in
        Ohio, as one of the major icons of Canada's entry into
        the industrial revolution.</p>

        4 people on board), count the gold, and all that. Those
        people were at the Bear Creek Compound, that we also
        toured. At its peak there were some 3000 people living in
        and around Bear Creek to keep the dredges active.<p>One
        of the buildings did catch my eye, this is the mine
        engineer's house - quite contemporary - aye.</p>

        thicker, but still bareable with the light breeze.<p>Wildlife
