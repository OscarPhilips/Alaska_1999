        lot of time looking for Ohio Signs but a few stood out (Cuyahoga
        Falls) some of which could be from any state, others like
        <em>Welcome to Springfield Ohio</em> leave litttle to

        Rancherio Campgrounds at 7:30 after traveling 307 miles.
        After freezing last night, being right off the frozen
        lake, we selected a campsite well protected from the
        winds, away from the river and canyon.<p>Again most of
        the miles were on excellent roads, we had maybe 25 miles
        of packed gravel, the balance good pavement.</p>
        <p>Wildlife for the day included: moose (2); mule deer (2);
        and caribou (3). During the late evening a large dog-like
        animal passed by the van. In our later journeys we would
        find out he was likely a wolf.</p>
