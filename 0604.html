        I guess we can include ourselves in the lucky part of
        that statistic. On our trip back to Anchorage the
        mountian &quot;came out,&quot; as they say here. We saw
        many spectacular views in the portions of our travel in
        which the mountain was visible.</p>

        <td colspan="2">Travel day, back to Anchorage to do a
        little laundry. On our travels from Denali back to
        Anchorage, at a small gas station near Talkneetna (if you
        call 15 miles away close) we ran into two of Donald's
        cousins, whom he has not seen for ~25 years, both now
        reside in Florida. In a quick review of our trip we found
        that we were within a few hours, or few miles of each
        other numerous times over the past few weeks. To make the
        story even stranger, back in Anchorage, we ran into them
        again at SAM's Club --- Small World.<p>Wildlife for the
        day included: moose (1) - sad travel day in comparison to
        some of our past days, but the leaves are coming out (that's
        right) and the wildlife is getting harder to see.</p>
        <p>Other activities for the day included laundry.</p>
