        morning, at 141 miles (Don started at his house I joined
        the trip at mileage 141) and traveled up thru Toledo, Ann
        Arbor, Flint, Mackinaw, Sault Ste. Marie, and into Canada.
        On our way we had planned to stop by some friends' house
        in Michigan, but alas, they were not home (we had tried
        to call before we left, but my sister gave us a bum
        number).</font></td>

        stops on our first day, but we did stop to see the
        Mackinaw Bridge. The bridge is 42 years old, and the
        longest suspension bridge in the United States.</font></td>

        about 30 miles into Canada, for our first night of
        camping in the van, at Pancake Campgrounds. This early in
        the season, we were one of only 2 or 3 groups, so the
        night was nice and quiet, other than the huge mosquitos
        that also lived at the camp grounds. </font></p>
