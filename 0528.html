        the ground, even at relatively realistic elevations. This
        snow was in one of the creek bottoms. We also experienced
        a short burst of intensive snow/sleet/hail. We realy don't
        know what to call it, it rained little snowballs, not ice,
        about the size of small peas.</td>

        that we are were they are supposed to be more popular, we
        have not seen any. We did see this pair of eagles sitting
        on the snow; in a later meeting with Mr. Ranger we found
        out these are either Golden Eagles or Yearling Bald
        Eagles (no white feathers on their head yet).</td>

        can come to Alaska without seeing a glacier. We walked
        out to the Matanusk Glaicer, where you could stand right
        on the glacier's toe. I was amazed at how much dirt and
        rock is actually on top of the glacier's ice at the toe
        that you walk over before you get to any exposed ice.</td>

        been to, but this is the first of the US holiday weekend.<p>Wildlife
