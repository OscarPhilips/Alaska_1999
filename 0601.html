        Our goal for the day, a little sight seeing and driving
        to the Denali area for tomorrow. Unluckily, it rained on
        and off most of the day, clearing up only as we
        approached Denali.</td>

        sites, including the Iditarod Headquarters. They have an
        interesting display and program. The cabin shown is
        similar to those used at the check points, and to many
        others in the back-country that the BLM maintains for
        short term use.</td>

        is the starting point for the 1000+ Mt. McKinley climbers,
        and visited with Mary Cary, an author and cook of fern
        tops. We sampled a few of her recipes for fern tops and
        found them very good.<p>Another moose.</p>

        through Denali Park. Since the early 70's driving
        personal cars through the park has been restricted, so it
        is either hike or ride. The bad part is the 4:30AM wake-up
        call.</p>
