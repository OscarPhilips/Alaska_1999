        Mint. Here they produce all of Canada's circulation
        coinage, and also produce coins for some 60 other
        countries. Unluckily they don't like tourists to take
        pictures of their mint in operation.<p>While we didn't
        get to leave the mint with any excess coinage, the
        Ontario Police chased us down anyway, it seems radar
        detectors are illegal in this province.</p>
